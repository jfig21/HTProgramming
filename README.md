# HTProgramming
Help To Programming Project

HTProgramming - Help To Programming is a tool with the objective of helping students and teachers throughout the initial process of teaching and learning programming. 
It includes a set of exercises divided by the different learning phases, with immediate feedback, reading suggestions, student profile and a machine-learning 
(neural network) predictive model of student failure. 
HTProgramming consists of the administration/teacher module and the student module, each with access to a remote database. 
The administration module is used by the teacher to control the entire teaching and learning process. The teacher has access to individual student data, such as
activities carried out, versions submitted and main difficulties. The set of results obtained is used in the student's failure predictive neural network model. 
The student module is used by students to build their learning profile. Students have at their disposal a set of activities, directly related to the contents covered,
which allow them to practice and test their knowledge. For each activity performed, the student receives immediate feedback, grades obtained, suggestions for reading or
reviewing, or even suggestions for new activities.
HTProgramming includes activities that, according to our experience better reflect the difficulties and needs of students in their initial learning of programming.
The activities are directly related to the introduction programming learning, in the C language. Introductory programming concepts, such as data types, names and 
identifiers and error identification. These types of activities are MCQ (Multiple Choice Question). Also includes Parson's problems are programming instructions in which
the the student must put in order to form a program with an objective.
